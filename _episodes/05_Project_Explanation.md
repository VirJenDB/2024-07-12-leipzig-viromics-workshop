### Title
Description

In this part of the workshop, we go through each step of the viromics analysis pipeline, utilizing the appropriate tools and methodologies at four stages. Here is the overview of the following stage:

## 1. Exploring Viromics Resources and Files
### Tools: Seqtk, FastQC

- **Seqtk**: Extract subsets of your data to make initial assessments easier and faster.
- **FastQC**: Generate comprehensive quality reports to identify any potential issues early on.

## 2. Quality Control and Taxonomic Profiling of One Virome
### Tools: Fastp, Kraken2 (using nf-core:taxoprofiler)

- **Fastp**: Clean your data by removing low-quality reads and adapters, ensuring high-quality input for downstream analyses.
- **Kraken2**: Assign taxonomic labels to your sequences, providing insights into the diversity of your virome.
- **nf-core:taxoprofiler**: An integrated pipeline that automates the taxonomic profiling process, improving efficiency and reproducibility.

## 3. Virome Assembly and Bin Evaluation
### Tools: MetaSPAdes, (Binning tool), CheckV

- **MetaSPAdes**: Assemble your sequencing data into longer contigs to reconstruct potential viral genomes.
- **Binning tools (e.g., MetaBAT2)**: Organize contigs into bins representing individual genomes, facilitating genome-centric analyses.
- **CheckV**: Evaluate the quality of your viral bins to ensure completeness and minimize contamination, enhancing the reliability of your results.

## 4. Virus Identification: geNomad
### Tool: geNomad

- **geNomad**: Identify and annotate viral sequences within your assembled contigs, providing crucial insights into the viral components of your sample.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Data Management and Storage**: Ensure you have adequate storage and a robust data management plan in place, as viromics data can be extensive. Here we use a tiny dataset to accelerate the preparation part. 
2. **Computational Resources**: Some of these tools require significant computational resources. Ensure you have access to high-performance computing facilities if necessary.
3. **Documentation and Reproducibility**: Keep detailed records of your commands, parameters, and tool versions to enhance process reproducibility.
4. **Visualization and Interpretation**: Post-analysis, use visualization tools like Krona for taxonomic profiles or Bandage for assembly graphs to better interpret the results.

By following these steps and leveraging the described tools, you will be able to perform an accurate analysis of a viromics dataset.
