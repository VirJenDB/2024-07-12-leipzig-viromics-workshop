We will first install the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) R package as it can take some time to install.
Open Rstudio **NOT** from within a conda environment, instead use the one that is pre-installed of the system. You can find it through the button in top left corner of the screen > programming > Rstudio.  

Next, install Tidyverse:

~~~
install.packages('tidyverse')
~~~

While Tidyverse is installing please listen to the lecture.
